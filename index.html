                            ProjectKick was born out of the desire to understand, visualize and connect with <br />
                            the creative culture of NYC. Kickstarter immediately came to mind as the perfect <br />
                            gateway, but we didn't want to stop at just one city. <p>

                        We collected thousands of current or successful project data points, across hundreds <br/>
                        of US cities going as far back as August 2009. We parsed the data to display in three <br/>
                        main ways- by city, category, and funding. <p>
                        Our goal is to help understand the creative culture across the country and see which <br />
                        categories the most popular projects fall under and are the most funded.</p>
